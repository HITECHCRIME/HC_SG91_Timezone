## Lyrics

```
there is only past and future
no present to speak of
(creeping) failure slowly time assured
no presets to lend off
untainted until send off
send off

there is only past and future
no present to speak of
creeping slowly time assured
no presets to lend off
untainted until send off
send off

time to be aware
has passed and broke off
usually it's knockoffs
like it's ali with no sign ups
your daily crazy-ness like a brilliant nest
nest of horents - sawed off
beaten down with finesse

crude crude logic
influenced but so apart - tres

fitting always wrapping
packs ain't missed when coming
that in sets

that in sets these bowing heads
to tantric rythm of the golden
synths - attunement
sound that clear
can pierce the eye                    ///(can pierce the middle eye)
in the middle - make an assumption        (making assumptions)
be besieged with a riddle
says that (credible) crid bleh              (incredible logi)
influenced 
jini of time
leaving with a sizzle
drunk on passing
drizzing
dre appealing
melting
demon filling



we all know our depth
some just admit
they feel not there
out of their depth
life like a shine
emphemeral and shit



sets your crude logic
influenced with emotional distress

```
